# Output ----------------------------------------
"""To run this code, you’ll need to have Python installed on your computer. 
You can then save this code to a file with a .py extension (e.g., hello.py) and 
run it from the command line using the python command followed by the name of the
file (e.g., python hello.py). This will execute the code and print the
output to the console."""

# Print "Hello, World!" to the console
print("Hello, World!")

# Input and Assignment --------------------------
"""This code takes input from the user using the input() function 
and assigns it to the user_input variable. The value of user_input 
is then assigned to another variable called my_variable. Finally,
the value of my_variable is printed using the print() function"""
# Take input from the user
user_input = input("Enter a value: ")

# Assign the input value to a variable
my_variable = user_input

# Print the value of the variable
print("The value of my_variable is:", my_variable)

# If statements ---------------------------------
"""In this example, we have two variables x and y with values 5 and 10,
respectively. The if statement checks if the condition x > y is True. 
If it is, the code within the if block is executed. In this case, the
condition is False, so the code moves on to the next condition in the
elif statement. This condition checks if x < y is True. Since it is,
the code within the elif block is executed and “x is less than y” is 
printed.

If neither the if nor the elif conditions are True, the code within the
else block is executed. In this example, since one of the previous 
conditions was True, the code within the else block is not executed."""

x = 5
y = 10

if x > y:
    print("x is greater than y")
elif x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
else:
    print("x is equal to y")
